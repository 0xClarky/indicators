**Crypto Volatility Index (TVI/CVI)**

What it shows:
- Volatility Index = ATR(14) / Close Ã— 100 on TOTAL market cap (ATR captures the average highâ€‘low range).
- Volatility MA = 30â€‘day moving average of the index to smooth the regime.

How to read:
- Spikes higher â†’ turbulence/liquidations, riskâ€‘off or unstable conditions.
- Troughs and contraction â†’ calmer markets, trends can persist (riskâ€‘on/complacency).
- Rising above its MA and expanding â†’ volatility regime shift up; more whipsaw risk.
- Falling below its MA and contracting â†’ calming regime; breakouts less likely.

Context with price:
- Price up + falling vol â†’ healthy, steady uptrend.
- Price up + rising vol â†’ vulnerable advance, distribution risk.
- Price down + rising vol â†’ stress/capitulation risk.
- Price down + falling vol â†’ selling exhaustion; meanâ€‘reversion potential.

Usage:
- Adjust position size and stop width with volatility (wider in high vol, tighter in low vol).
- Combine with trend/levels; this is not a directional signal on its own.

Data note:
- Requires high/low/close for ATR. If missing, the calculation will fail.
