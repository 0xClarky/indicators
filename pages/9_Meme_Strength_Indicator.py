    This plot maps the relationship between the broader crypto market and the highly speculative "meme coin" sector.
    
    1.  **Meme Index**: An equally-weighted index is created from the assets in the `MEME_COIN_BASKET`.
    2.  **Performance Calculation**: For each day, the 30-day performance (ROC) is calculated for both the Meme Index (Y-Axis) and the `TOTAL` market cap (X-Axis).
    3.  **Plotting**: Each dot on the chart represents a single day, plotted according to these two performance metrics.

    The location of the dots reveals the market's risk appetite:

    - **<font color='lightgreen'>üü¢ Broad Rally</font>** (Top-Right): Both the market and meme coins are performing well. Memes outperforming (dots above the dashed line) signals high risk appetite.
    
    - **<font color='lightblue'>üîµ Risk-On Rotation</font>** (Top-Left): Meme coins are rising while the broader market is falling. This can signal speculative rotation or a "last hurrah" for a rally.
    
    - **<font color='orange'>üü† Defensive</font>** (Bottom-Left): Both the market and memes are falling, a clear risk-off environment.
    
    - **<font color='tomato'>üî¥ Market-Led Weakness</font>** (Bottom-Right): The market is falling faster than meme coins, or memes are flat while the market drops. This can signal broader weakness that hasn't fully hit the speculative corners yet.
